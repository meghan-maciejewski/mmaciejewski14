Research in the [Bolnick lab](https://bolnicklab.wordpress.com) broadly focuses on ecology, evolution, and immunology. During my time as a tech (2018-2020), the lab's primary interest was the evolution of peritoneal fibrosis, an immune response some populations of threespine stickleback show in response to infection by *Schistocephalus solidus* tapeworms. I provided assistance on experiments, maintained the lab populations of stickleback, and was involved in a few data-analysis side projects ([Maciejewski et al. 2019, Evol. Ecol. Res.; Maciejewski et al. 2020, Evolution]{style="color: teal"}).

The [Bleakley lab](https://www.smallcheerfulcreatures.org) uses guppies to study the evolution of cooperation and indirect genetic effects. As an undergraduate in the lab (2016-2018) I worked on various projects related to behavior and sensory ecology (eg. quantifying variation in lateral line morphology, measuring social learning and cooperation, and characterizing individual differences in responsiveness to visual and chemical sensory cues).

Research in the [Mullineaux lab](https://www2.whoi.edu/site/mullineauxlab/research/) focuses on marine larval dispersal and benthic ecology. As a Summer Student Fellow and Guest Student in the lab (2017-2018), I investigated the function of helical swimming behavior in oyster larvae. Many planktonic marine larvae swim in helices, however the function of this behavior is largely unknown. For my summer project, I tested whether helical swimming may serve as a feeding behavior and/or a response to conspecific chemical settlement cues ([Maciejewski et al. 2019, JEMBE]{style="color: teal"}).

I joined the Drew lab for the summer of 2016 through a National Science Foundation Research Experience for Undergraduates. At the time, the lab was interested in the molecular mechanisms facilitating the mutualistic interaction between damselfishes and their host sea anemones. For my project, I used qPCR to compare the expression levels of a mucin-secretion gene (thought to facilitate the formation of a protective mucus layer on the skin of damselfish) in skin tissue from clownfish that were or were not associated with sea anemones.
